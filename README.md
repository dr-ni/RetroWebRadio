A nice SDL Webradio GUI

## Description
This is a simple mpd webradio SDL frontend initially made by Florian Arnhein (http://amrhein.eu/nw/roehre/ui/).
It is a complete overwork of the initially made version in order to remove bugs and not requiring an external parser.
This version has now also included 3 potentiometer-daemons for gpio control with rotary encoders KY-040 on a Raspberry PI.
The radio stations are now predefined in a stationslist.txt and has to be converted to a stations.xml inifile before usage.
